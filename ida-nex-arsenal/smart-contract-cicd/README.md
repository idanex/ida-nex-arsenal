# Tool: Smart Contract CI/CD Pipeline
> An industrial-grade GitHub Actions pipeline to automate the testing, security auditing, and deployment of your smart contracts.

---
## ?? The Problem
Deploying smart contracts manually is a recipe for disaster. This pipeline industrializes and secures this critical process.

## ? Features
1.  **?? Automated Testing:** Runs Brownie tests on every push.
2.  **??? Security Audit:** Executes a Slither audit to detect vulnerabilities.
3.  **?? Testnet Deployment:** Deploys to Kovan if tests and audit pass.

---
## ??? Usage
1.  Copy the .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml file into your repository.
2.  Adapt the deploy.py script to your contract's artifact path.
3.  Configure PRIVATE_KEY and INFURA_PROJECT_ID as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
