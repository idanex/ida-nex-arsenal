# The Ida Nex™ Arsenal

> Forging the Future of Web3, One Tool at a Time.

---

## 🏛️ Philosophy

A vision without execution is a hallucination. While the [Conceptual Foundry](https://github.com/idanex/conceptual-foundry) holds my paradigm-defining works, this Arsenal contains the battle-tested tools required to build them.

Every tool in this repository is offered freely to the community to elevate the standards of security, efficiency, and robustness in the Web3 ecosystem.

## 🛠️ The Tools

*   **[Smart Contract CI/CD Pipeline](./smart-contract-cicd/)** - An industrial-grade pipeline for automated testing, auditing, and deployment.
*   **[Smart Contract Watchdog](./smart-contract-watchdog/)** - A real-time monitoring script for on-chain events with instant SMS alerts.
*   *(More tools are being forged...)*
